          <h2>Importance of freshwater habitats</h2>
          <p>
            Freshwater refers to water from rivers, lakes, reservoirs,
            underground streams, and other sources. Freshwater ecosystems
            contribute to biodiversity, the economy, recreational opportunities,
            cultural significance and our well-being. Freshwater is used by a
            wide variety of native plants and animals. Some of these are unique
            to New Zealand and often highly specialised to the habitats they are
            found in. Tangata whenua have strong links to water. Awa (river) are
            an important part of whakapapa (geneaology) and freshwater sustains
            taniwha and protects wāhi tapu (sacred areas). Awa also provide
            valuable resources such as mahinga kai (harvesting), harakeke (flax)
            and habitat for species of cultural importance (e.g. tuna/eels).

          <h2>Threats and pressures</h2>
          <p>
            Our freshwater ecosystems are impacted by a number of pressures.
            These include land use change and intensification, deforestation,
            drainage, reduced flows, pollution, sedimentation, nutrient
            enrichment and spread of invasive species. These pressures have had
            significant consequences for our freshwater species, which are
            vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation, competition and
            predation from invasive species, overharvest and interbreeding.
            Freshwater pests including koi carp are found in and threaten our
            freshwater ecosystems. The CRESP research programme addresses four
            pressures on New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems.
