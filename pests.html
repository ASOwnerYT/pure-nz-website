          <p>
            Invasive freshwater pests reduce water quality, compete against and
            feed on native freshwater fish, invertebrates, and plants,
            contribute to erosion and increase nutrient levels in New Zealand’s
            waterways.

          <h2>Koi carp</h2>
          <p>
            Koi carp contribute to poor water quality and are a serious problem
            in both Australia and New Zealand. Koi carp look very like goldfish,
            except they grow to larger sizes (in New Zealand up to 10 kg and 75
            cm long) and have two pairs of whisker-like feelers, also called
            barbels, at the corners of their mouth. They are highly variable in
            colour, often accompanied with irregular blotching of black, red,
            gold, orange or pearly white. Koi carp prefer still waters in lakes,
            or backwaters in rivers. They are highly tolerant of poor water
            quality and contribute to water quality decline.

          <h2>Gambusia</h2>
          <p>
            Gambusia were originally introduced to New Zealand and is now a pest
            fish negatively impacting our freshwater ecosystems.
            <br />
            There are several ways in which these fish pose a threat to our
            freshwater ecosystems:
            <br />
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Gambusia are more aggressive than our native fish and frequently
              nip at their eyes and fins.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gambusia also compete with native fish for food and have been
              known to eat native fish eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to their fast breeding, gambusia can quickly outnumber native
              fish in a stream and take over a waterway.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once in large numbers, gambusia eat larvae of native insects, such
              as dragonflies, affecting the populations of these species.
            </li>
